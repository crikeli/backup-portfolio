<p>Zest iOS is the mobile implementation of the web-application ZestJS. During the development of the app, I worked with several Apple frameworks like Map-Kit, Core-Location and Cocoapods whilst designing a pixel perfect UI. I also utilized the <a href="https://moltin.com/" target="_blank"> Moltin API </a> (which is a back-end as a service that supports secure E-commerce). I have yet to develop an onboarding feature for the app, however, the majority of the application is developed and fully functional.</p>
