title: Zest JS
---
##### I undertook this project as my very first full "end-to-end" project after I had just finished the MEAN(Mongo, Express, Angular, NodeJS) stack at Coding Dojo. I wanted to apply my newly learnt web development knowledge to create a practical, real-world application.

Zest is an e-commerce web-application with methods to securely browse and purchase food from local restaurants. It is designed as a means to help restaurants reduce food wastage and to market themselves to a wider audience.

##### Below are some screenshots of the application in action.
