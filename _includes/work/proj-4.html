I undertook this project and used TensorFlow to classify aerial views of images using <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/" target="_blank">Transfer Learning</a>, which is a subfield of Deep-Learning.</h5>

<p>The purpose of the project was to understand the workings and power of Googleâ€™s <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2016/03/train-your-own-image-classifier-with.html" target="_blank">Inception Model</a> whilst applying it to solve a real-world classification problem. Below, I discuss my methodology and results.</p>
